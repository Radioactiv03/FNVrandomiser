This is a texture randomiser made for new vegas but can work for other bethesda games, although it is untested. Feel free to message me if it does not work for your game

How to use
Simply run the randomiser.exe file and point it to the games data folder
From here follow the instructions on screen to extract the textures, sound or meshes files
You will then get the option to randomise these files.
You can then launch the game like normal, however I would strongly recommend XNVSE, NVAC and the 4gb patch to make the game slightly more stable



To uninstall
simple delete the textures and sound folder and then verify your game files.
I am not responsible for breaking your game :)

The BSA Browser cli code was modified to allow it to be ran through the .exe to extract files which then gets randomised
All other code was kept the same
